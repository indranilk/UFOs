# UFOs

Overview

  The purpose of the assignment is to analyze UFO sighting data. We added specific filters for date, city, state, country, and shape. We used an index.html file along with app and data JavaScript files. The data file has all the UFO data which will be displayed on the webpage. The app JavaScript file has code which loops through the entire data JavaScript file. After looping the entire dataset, the information is appended to a table before being loaded onto the page.

Results

  The user searches specific data by filtering information. The text fields that can be filtered are date, city, state, country, and shape. 
If you enter a date such as 1/2/2010 it shows all the UFO sighting dates of 1/2/2010.

If you filter by date and state then it shows the two dates on 1/2/2010 for California

If you filter by date, state, and shape then you will see one row with date 1/2/2010, state California, and shape light

Summary

  One drawback of this website is the alignment of the paragraphs of information and the data below. The information is too close to each other which can make it hard for viewers to read all the information. Someone can get confused about what the webpage is displaying.
  
  One way to improve the webpage would be to decrease the size of the text fields so the UFO sighting data could be moved slightly to the left. It would be easier to read the data once it is filtered. Another way to improve the webpage would be to move the text “Filter Search” to the right so it would be easier to read while scrolling down the web page.
